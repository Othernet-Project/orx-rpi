Updating HOWTO
==============

To update ORxPi, including the `Outernet DIY receiver kit`_, you first need to
obtain the update image. Go to `archive.outernet.is/images/`_ and download the
file named `ORxPi-update-latest.zip`_.

Unzip the file. You will find a single file named ``zImage`` inside it. Insert
the bootable ORxPi SD card into the card reader and replace the existing 
``zImage`` file with the new one.

Put the card back into Raspberry Pi and power it up. This completes the update
process.
